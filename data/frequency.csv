Too big of a chance for something to go wrong that could cause hyperpigmentation and scaring. There are YouTube videos you can watch. Micro Needling is okay, but she didn’t do it correctly. You must also make sure to get a test of a new procedure done in an area on your body where the skin is similar like the back of your hand or underside of your wrist. That way you can see how your skin will react. I had some electrolysis done on my upper lip and that area was very sensitive and I scarred like you but with small holes where she used the needle. I had had it numerous times on my chin, but the upper lip is far more sensitive. I’m similar skin tone and I was afraid of hyperpigmentation as I can get it sometimes even from a raised pimple, but they did completely heal and lighten. I used a serum for hyperpigmentation as well which helped.***Rect(84, 702 - 692, 1042)||What’s the best serum for hyperpigmentation you’ve found? I’ve been trying loads of different ones, but the only thing that seems to really make a difference for me is the TO niacinamide. Looking for any recommendations you have for evening skin tone - I have a ton of hyperpigmentation from pimples as well.

There are exemptions to fasting such as age (too young/old), illness, and, for women, getting your period. When I was young, we would pray our periods would come so we didn't have to fast, and we weren't expected to. Sometimes, women pretend to have their period longer than they really do to avoid fasting. This is a long-standing joke between us women that we hope you get a long period to avoid fasting. Hope that helps.

***Rect(28, 1391 - 655, 1443)||Used make-up cannot be sold on Vinted (if that's what this is), it is against the ToS for health reasons. You can get in contact with Vinted for this reason.
***Rect(28, 1443 - 692, 1450)||They should definitely have put this photo in the original listing, not send in a message. They probably think they're covering their ass now by sending you this photo which is not true - listings have to be accurately described in the first place. https://www.vinted.co.uk/help/1090
***Rect(28, 1543 - 692, 1450)||If you're not happy with the sale - cancel it (you have one free cancellation where you won't get automatic negative feedback). If it's already on its way and sent to a locker/drop off, you can just not pick up the item and it should be automatically sent back to the seller.***Rect(28, 1667 - 692, 1450)||Join the conversation***Rect(14, 1460 - 552, 1524)||",0,2048
